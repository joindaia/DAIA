# Experimental model request gate

`daia.model_request.RequestGate` is a pure validator, not a credential proxy or
production account-isolation boundary. Run it outside the guest before attaching
credentials. Its initial route is the synthetic `/v1/responses` laboratory route.

A trusted controller supplies an independently approved JSON template. Never learn
that approval from the first guest request. All non-history fields remain frozen;
local function tools and function namespaces are allowed, provider-executed tools
are not. Only explicit text messages, local function calls and text outputs are
accepted in history. Remote files, item references, previous-response links, opaque
reasoning state, duplicate keys, nonfinite numbers and unknown fields are denied.
The returned JSON is canonicalized; a caller must forward those returned bytes.

This establishes parser behavior only. HTTP framing/headers, routing, TLS, credential
injection, limits, revocation and service isolation are not implemented here. History
is untrusted candidate text, not proof of tool execution. Trusted local tool dispatch
and evaluation remain separate obligations.

Compatibility ceiling: images, encrypted reasoning, WebSockets and compaction are not
yet supported. These may be necessary for useful real Codex work. Do not call the
subscription objective complete by disabling useful behavior to fit this validator.
Public research must remain available through the separate bounded guest research
route. The next test is integration with the pinned native client, followed by adding
necessary representations only when their authority and ownership can be checked.

Validation: 25 local tests cover multi-turn text/function history, assignment
namespaces, native MCP text outputs and negative authority/parser cases. These tests
do not establish real provider authentication, provider-side scope or VM integration.
